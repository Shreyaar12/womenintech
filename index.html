                    This decade has seen an increase in women's participation in the IT (information technology) industry as they make up 34 percent of the total workforce in the sector, according to the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology 2017-2018. It stands third-highest among all non-agricultural sectors in the country after e-commerce (67.7%) and retail (52%) as per NASSCOM in 2018. A March 2020 NASSCOM report “India's Tech Industry: Women For The Techade” says that women constitute 35 percent of India's technology industry. 

                    <span class="text-highlight"> While women are increasingly joining the workforce in the tech industry, it is also important to note that young girls in India comprise 30 percent of engineering students which is among the highest in the world and more than the developed nations like the US, UK, Germany and France as per All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE).
               </span>
                    These numbers show an upward trend in women's participation in the technology industry in India; however, a lot needs to be done to achieve gender equality in this space when it comes to women's representation in key decision-making roles in tech-based companies. 
                    
                    <span class="text-highlight">Today, when engineering roles are considered viable professional options for women in Indian households in the long run, it is also a reality that we see a leak in the pipeline which doesn't allow women to reach higher positions in their career. This is as true for the tech sector, as it is for any other corporate sector in India, given that gender-based biases and patriarchal mindset continue to plague Indian society at all levels.

A veteran of the technology industry, she is the fifth president of NASSCOM and the first women at the helm in three-decade history.

                            She is a firm believer in the power of technology in enhancing lives and livelihoods, leveraging it for societal good. She was instrumental in developing 'Think Digital, Think India' strategy aimed at establishing India as a hub for digital talent and innovation.

                            As the NASSCOM President, she actively works with the industry and Government to accelerate the growth of the Industry and strengthen India's position as hub for Innovation and Digital Talent. Her approach has been focused on a three-point agenda - talent development and re-skilling, strengthening the innovation culture in the country and collaborating with governments across the world to open new opportunities for the Indian IT industry.
                            
                            The pandemic has created a tremendous opportunity for the tech industry to reinvent itself. The NASSCOM playbook for reimagining the industry focuses on Trust, Digital Talent, People-first Innovation, Agility & Resilience as the core differentiators. Debjani believes that by leveraging these differentiators to the fullest, we can create a future that's better than the past.
                            
                            In January 2018, she was felicitated by the President of India under the auspices of the 'First Ladies' program, which honors exceptional women pioneers in their respective fields. In 2020, she has been honored by Vogue as the Tech Leader of the year 2020. She has also been listed among the India's most powerful women in tech by Business Today.

She believes that learning never stops and a trainable mindset is the biggest strength one can have.
